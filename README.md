Alumni donations are an important source of revenue for colleges and universities. If administrators could determine the factors that influence increases in the percentage of alumni who donate, they might be able to implement policies that could lead to increased revenues.

A study shows that students who have more access to the faculty are more likely to be satisfied. As a result, one might suspect that smaller class sizes and lower student-faculty ratios might lead to a higher percentage of satisfied graduates, which in turn might lead to an increase in the percentage of alumni who donate.

In this project we will answer the following questions:

Is there a relationship between the factors and the alumni giving rate?

How strong is the relationship between the factors and alumni giving rate?

How accurately can we estimate the effect of each factor on the alumni giving rate?
